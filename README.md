### Project Description
This tool helps you find the countdown to your favorite holidays quickly and visually. Simply type the name of a holiday in the search box, and the calendar for that holiday‚Äôs month will appear with the holiday date highlighted. You will also see how many days remain until that special day, along with a short description explaining the significance or meaning of the holiday. This way, you stay informed and excited about upcoming celebrations and important dates throughout the year

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 You just type a holiday name‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre a little off spelling‚Äîand our clever code guesses what you mean (because who remembers the exact spelling of ‚ÄúKarkkidaka Vavu‚Äù anyway?
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
‚Äî updating days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until the holiday.
